# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project 
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

a) Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory

b) Read files as tables and assign these to variables

c) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

d) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

e) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

f) Put Appropriate labels to the data set with descriptive variable names

g) Creates a tidy dataset (tidy.txt) that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
